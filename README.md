# Blog Application

## Overview
This is a full-stack blog application that allows users to register, log in, create, edit, and delete blog posts. The application features a **React frontend** and an **Express.js backend**, utilizing **MongoDB** for data storage. User authentication is managed via **JWT (JSON Web Token)**, and uploaded images are stored in an `uploads/` directory.

## Features
- User authentication (Register/Login/Logout)
- Create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Image upload functionality for blog posts
- Secure authentication using JWT
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- React.js
- React Router
- React Quill (for rich-text editing)
- CSS (for styling)

### Backend
- Node.js & Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication
- Multer for image uploads
- bcrypt.js for password hashing

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mahema1/blog-application.git
cd blog-application
```

### 2. Install dependencies
#### Backend
Navigate to the `api/` directory and install dependencies:
```sh
cd api

```

#### Frontend
Navigate to the `client/` directory and install dependencies:
```sh
cd ../client

```

### 3. Set up MongoDB
Make sure you have **MongoDB** installed and running locally, or use **MongoDB Atlas**.

Update the `mongoose.connect()` URI inside `index.js` with your MongoDB connection string:

mongoose.connect('your-mongodb-connection-string');
```

### 4. Start the development servers

cd api
node index.js
```
(Default backend runs on **http://localhost:4000**)

#### Frontend
```sh
cd ../client
yarn start
```
(Default frontend runs on **http://localhost:3000**)
